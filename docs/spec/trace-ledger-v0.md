# Trace Ledger v0

Trace Ledger v0 defines the minimal JSON record emitted for every runtime invocation.

## Contract Goals
- Emit one JSON ledger entry per invocation, including failures.
- Include stable identifiers and timing fields for replay/audit.
- Record runtime-supported contract versions used at invocation time.
- Encode invocation outcome as `success` or `failure` with error details for failures.

## Ledger Shape (v0)
- `schema_version` (string, required): fixed to `0.1.0`.
- `run_id` (string, required): unique invocation id generated by runtime.
- `started_at` (RFC3339 string, required): invocation start timestamp.
- `completed_at` (RFC3339 string, required): invocation completion timestamp.
- `contract_versions` (object, required):
  - `semantic_ir` (string, required)
  - `policy_profile` (string, required)
- `outcome` (object, required):
  - Success: `{ "status": "success" }`
  - Failure: `{ "status": "failure", "error": { "name": string, "message": string } }`
