Implement the legacy continuation benchmark report for M2 so CI can evaluate token efficiency without counting invalid gains.
The benchmark command must emit a structured artifact with per-task efficiency ratio, aggregate median and p90 metrics, and machine-readable quality-floor validity signals.
Fail the gate when efficiency appears to meet the target but required checks, policy, acceptance criteria, or traceability conditions are not preserved.
Document the report schema, thresholds, and reproducible local run steps, and keep deterministic output ordering for stable diffs.
