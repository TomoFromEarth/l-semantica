Add minimal CI wiring for the legacy continuation benchmark gate using the existing benchmark command.
The CI step should enforce the M2 objective threshold and fail when the benchmark report marks the gain invalid.
Keep the change narrow, reuse checked-in threshold configuration, and avoid introducing a separate workflow unless strictly necessary.
Preserve deterministic benchmark report serialization, include artifact references in the report inputs, and update tests so gate enforcement regressions are caught locally.
