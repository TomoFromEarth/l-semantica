# Governance

## Roles
- Maintainers: set roadmap, review/merge changes, steward quality and security.
- Contributors: propose and implement improvements through issues/PRs/RFCs.

## Decision Process
- Small changes: maintainer review + merge.
- Design-impacting changes: RFC required in `rfcs/`.
- Breaking changes: explicit acceptance in an RFC and migration notes.

## Project Direction
The project follows a gate-based roadmap:
- semantic correctness
- reliability and policy controls
- legacy continuation
- multi-target generation
- long-horizon autonomous evolution

## Conflict Resolution
When consensus is unclear, maintainers decide based on:
1. Safety and correctness
2. Long-term maintainability
3. Alignment with accepted RFCs
